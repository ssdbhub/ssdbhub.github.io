    <div class="article-body content-body wikistyle markdown-format">

        <p>By using the GitHub.com web site ("Service"), or any services of GitHub, Inc ("GitHub"), you are agreeing
            to be bound by the following terms and conditions ("Terms of Service"). IF YOU ARE ENTERING INTO THIS
            AGREEMENT ON BEHALF OF A COMPANY OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO
            BIND SUCH ENTITY, ITS AFFILIATES AND ALL USERS WHO ACCESS OUR SERVICES THROUGH YOUR ACCOUNT TO THESE
            TERMS AND CONDITIONS, IN WHICH CASE THE TERMS "YOU" OR "YOUR" SHALL REFER TO SUCH ENTITY, ITS AFFILIATES
            AND USERS ASSOCIATED WITH IT. IF YOU DO NOT HAVE SUCH AUTHORITY, OR IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THESE TERMS
            AND CONDITIONS, YOU MUST NOT ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT AND MAY NOT USE THE SERVICES.</p>

        <p>Please note that if you are accessing any GitHub service in your capacity as a government entity, there
            are special terms that may apply to you. Please see Section G.17, below, for more details.</p>

        <p>If GitHub makes material changes to these Terms, we will notify you by email or by posting a notice on
            our site before the changes are effective. Any new features that augment or enhance the current Service,
            including the release of new tools and resources, shall be subject to the Terms of Service. Continued
            use of the Service after any such changes shall constitute your consent to such changes. You can review
            the most current version of the Terms of Service at any time at: <a
                    href="https://github.com/site/terms">https://github.com/site/terms</a></p>

        <p>Violation of any of the terms below will result in the termination of your Account. While GitHub
            prohibits such conduct and Content on the Service, you understand and agree that GitHub cannot be
            responsible for the Content posted on the Service and you nonetheless may be exposed to such materials.
            You agree to use the Service at your own risk.</p>

                Content is posted by others who have accounts under your account).</p></li>
            <li><p>One person or legal entity may not maintain more than one free account, and one <a

        <p>Customers may access their GitHub account data via an API (Application Program Interface). Any use of the
            API, including use of the API through a third-party product that accesses GitHub, is bound by these
            Terms of Service plus the following specific terms:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><p>You expressly understand and agree that GitHub shall not be liable for any direct, indirect,
                incidental, special, consequential or exemplary damages, including but not limited to, damages for
                loss of profits, goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses (even if GitHub has been advised of
                the possibility of such damages), resulting from your use of the API or third-party products that
                access data via the API.</p></li>
            <li><p>Abuse or excessively frequent requests to GitHub via the API may result in the temporary or
                permanent suspension of your account's access to the API. GitHub, in its sole discretion, will
                determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. GitHub will make a reasonable attempt via email to
                warn the account owner prior to suspension.</p></li>
            <li><p>GitHub reserves the right at any time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, your
                access to the API (or any part thereof) with or without notice.</p></li>

        </h3>

        <ol>
            <li><p>All paid plans must enter a valid payment account. Free accounts are not required to provide
                payment account information.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>An upgrade from the free plan to any paying plan will immediately bill you.</strong></p>
            </li>
            <li><p>For monthly payment plans, <strong>the Service is billed in advance on a monthly basis and is
                non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, upgrade/downgrade
                refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open account. In order to treat everyone equally, no
                exceptions will be made.</strong></p></li>
            <li><p><strong>When changing from a monthly billing cycle to a yearly billing cycle, GitHub will bill
                for a full year at the next monthly billing date.</strong></p></li>
            <li><p>All fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities, and you
                shall be responsible for payment of all such taxes, levies, or duties, excluding only United States
                (federal or state) taxes.</p></li>
            <li><p>For any upgrade or downgrade in plan level while on a monthly billing cycle, the credit card that
                you provided will automatically be charged the new rate on your next billing cycle.
                For upgrades or downgrades while on a yearly plan, GitHub will immediately charge or refund the
                difference in plan cost, prorated for the remaining time in your yearly billing cycle.</p></li>
            <li><p>Downgrading your Service may cause the loss of Content, features, or capacity of your Account.
                GitHub does not accept any liability for such loss.</p></li>

        <ol>
            <li><p><strong>You are solely responsible for properly canceling your account. An email or phone request
                to cancel your account is not considered cancellation. You can cancel your account at any time by
                clicking on the Account link in the global navigation bar at the top of the screen. The Account
                screen provides a simple no questions asked cancellation link.</strong></p></li>
            <li><p>All of your Content will be immediately deleted from the Service upon cancellation. This
                information can not be recovered once your account is cancelled.</p></li>
            <li><p>If you cancel the Service before the end of your current paid up month, your cancellation will
                take effect immediately and you will not be charged again.</p></li>
            <li><p>GitHub, in its sole discretion, has the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any
                and all current or future use of the Service, or any other GitHub service, for any reason at any
                time. Such termination of the Service will result in the deactivation or deletion of your Account or
                your access to your Account, and the forfeiture and relinquishment of all Content in your Account.
                GitHub reserves the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time.</p></li>
            <li><p>In the event that GitHub takes action to suspend or terminate an account, we will make a
                reasonable effort to provide the affected account owner with a copy of their account contents upon
                request, unless the account was suspended or terminated due to unlawful conduct.</p></li>
